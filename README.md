Dynamic-Programming
===================

Open source generic templates for dynamic programming. 
Simple, fast, and easy to use. Consistent logic. It does not intend to code tricky logic for a particular problem, but rather, simple, straight forward so anyone could follow for their problems.

To start, try Permutations. This template deals with all kinds of permutations, either it's regular string, or parenthesis. It also handles duplicated character in strings automatically, like 'abac'. 

Even if someone does not really grasp the idea of the dynamic programming, they could still use / hook up dynamic programming code easily. Code examples will be provided as well. 

Credit: The idea is originated from reading sample code from 'cracking the code interview' and LeetCode.
